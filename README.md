This is a pretty much exact clone of the NES 4-Score adapter (PAL version)

I did this nondestructively by scanning the bottom of the board and tracing the board.
There is no scan of the top side because there are no traces on it and i'd have to desolder the controller ports, potentionally wrecking them.
